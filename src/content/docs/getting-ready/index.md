description: A guide to setting up Crostini/Linux Development Environment
---

Setting up Crostini is fairly easy, but we decided to include this guide for simplicity.

## Installation

First, head over to Settings -> About ChromeOS -> Set up Linux Development Environment

Then, give it atleast 10GB and click "install". This will take from 2-6 minutes depending on device.

## Finishing

Lastly, run the following command to update the container. You are done!

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
