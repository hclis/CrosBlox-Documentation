## About CrosBlox

CrosBlox is a new solution coded purely in Python that allows users on ChromeBooks to use Roblox Studio easily. Of course, as they are not officialy supported devices, you will need to accept the hard truth
that CrosBlox will not always work and will sometimes break. It is coded in python and for now we have made the decision to keep it's source code confidential.
